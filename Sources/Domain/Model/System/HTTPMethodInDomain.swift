/// HTTPMethod in domain.

/// The purpose of defining this in the Domain layer is to reduce the dependency on the framework. It's also intended to clarify the HTTPMethod within the project's domain.
/// ### Note
/// Continuing from the namespace is Domain.HTTPMethodInDomain. This may seem verbose. I named it because I didn't want to confuse it with NIOHTTP1.HTTPMethod.
/// ### Extra
/// I'm want hotly for [enum subsets features](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160530/020054.html) in Swift.ðŸ˜Š
